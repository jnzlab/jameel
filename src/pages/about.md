## Who I Am

I am **Jameel Ahmad**, a **Full Stack Web Developer** and Computer Science student at **GIFT University**. With over two years of experience specializing in **Next.js**, I focus on building scalable web applications that bridge the gap between high-performance code and intelligent user experiences.

I have graduated my **BS Computer Science** with a **CGPA of 3.8/4.0**. 

## Technical Philosophy

As a developer, I am framework-agnostic and deeply committed to continuous learning. Whether it's automating video pipelines or contributing to the tools I use daily, I enjoy solving complex problems that create real-world value.

### Core Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Go (Golang), Drizzle ORM, and PostgreSQL.
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Vercel (CI/CD), and FFmpeg.

## Beyond the Code

### Research & AI
I am the first author of a published research paper, **"Classification of 24 Skin Conditions Using Swin Transformer,"** featured in IET Conference Proceedings. This academic background fuels my interest in integrating AI into web platforms, such as the dermatology diagnostic tool I developed at GIFT University.

### Open Source
I am an active contributor to the developer ecosystem, with contributions to:
- **Clerk** (Auth & Session Management).
- **Neon** (Serverless PostgreSQL).
- **Appwrite** (API & Security).
- **IOPaint**: Developed a bulk watermark removal script using Python and PyTorch.

### Achievements
- **1st Place (District level):** Led my university team in the **CERTs Challenge 2022**, focusing on emergency response and mass casualty management.
