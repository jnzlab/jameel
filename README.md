# 🚀 Jameel Ahmad | Portfolio & Blog

Welcome to the source code of my personal website! This project serves as my digital home where I showcase my professional work, open-source contributions, and share my journey through technical blog posts.

Live Site: **[jnzlab.com](https://jnzlab.com)**

## 👤 About This Project

This site is built to represent my identity as a **Full Stack Web Developer**. It’s not just a portfolio; it’s a living document of my experiences in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, my research in AI, and my transition into backend development with Go.

### Key Features:

* **Portfolio:** A showcase of my work, including video transcoding platforms and AI-powered web applications.
* **Blog:** Insights on Next.js, Fedora Linux, FFmpeg, and my experiences as a Computer Science student at GIFT University.
* **Performance:** Built with Astro for lightning-fast loading and optimal SEO.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** [Astro](https://astro.build/) (AstroPaper Theme)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Search:** Fuse.js
* **Deployment:** Vercel
* **Domain Management:** AWS Route 53

## 📖 Content Strategy

I use the blog section to document:

1. **Technical Tutorials:** Solving specific bugs in Next.js or configuring Fedora.
2. **Project Deep-Dives:** Explaining the "why" behind my architectural choices (like HLS streaming or SQL optimization).
3. **Career Journey:** Sharing my path as a Junior Software Engineer and open-source contributor.

## 🏃 Local Development

If you'd like to run this project locally to see how I've structured my Astro components:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jnzlab/jameel.git

```


2. **Install dependencies:**
